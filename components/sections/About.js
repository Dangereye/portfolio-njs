              My experience thus far has primarily been front-end. However, I do
              have some basic knowledge of back-end technologies, such as Node,
              Express, Mongoose and Mongo DB.

              React has predominantly been my focus during the last 12 months,
              with several small projects under my belt. I intend to explore
              Next.js to use in conjunction with React and take a deeper dive
              into back-end technologies over the coming months.
